# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The project will summarize ride-sharing data from 2019/01/01 to 2019/04/29. The summary will provide total riders, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver information and group the data into three types, rural, suburban, and urban. Then, the project will showcase weekly fares for each city type by line chart. Overall, the project will provide a compelling visualization for any disparities among the city types by the summary and line chart.
